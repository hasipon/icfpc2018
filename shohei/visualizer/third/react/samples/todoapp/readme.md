# Haxe React sample: Todo

The classic Todo app done using Haxe React and a Flux-like store.

## Building

    haxelib install msignal
    haxelib install react
    haxe build.hxml

## Haxe React

We believe Haxe+React is an excellent combination; here's the render function of the main view:

```haxe
override public function render() 
{
	var unchecked = state.items.filter(function(item) return !item.checked).length;

	return jsx('
		<div className="app">
			<div className="header">
				<input ref="input" placeholder="Enter new task description" />
				<button className="button-add" onClick=$addItem>+</button>
			</div>
			<$TodoList data=${state.items}/>
			<div className="footer">$unchecked task(s) left</div>
		</div>
	');
}
```

The JSX transformation is implemented as a `jsx()` macro, producing code which will be verified 
by the Haxe compiler. You can use both classic `{}` syntax or Haxe string interpolation for improved
IDE integration. 

Note: you don't have to add `$` in `<$TodoList>`, it's just for code navigation convenience.

And as you can see, the whole React API is strongly typed and using `override` you can easily, 
and safely, implement the common lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `shouldComponentUpdate`...).

## Flux-like store

This sample includes a very simple, no dependencies, flux-like store, implemented using `msignal` 
for the eventing:

- `TodoActions` defines static strongly typed signals for each action destinated to the store,
- `TodoStore` instance listens to the actions and dispatches a `changed` signal to notify listeners.
